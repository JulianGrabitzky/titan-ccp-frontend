## Developing

To work with this project, clone this repository and execute:

````bash
npm install
````

To start a development server execute:

````bash
npm run dev
````

A good tool for working on this software is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
In order to get things like autocomletion for `.vue` files, you need to install the [vetur](https://vuejs.github.io/vetur/) plugin.
When you open a vue file the first time, Visual Studio Code suggests to install this plugin.

*IMPORTANT: Currently (25/04/2018), you need (at least) vetur 0.11.8, which is only available as a Github Release: [Vetur 0.11.8](https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/releases/tag/0.11.8)*
